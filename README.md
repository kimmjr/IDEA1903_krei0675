##About the Artwork
For my individual piece, I selected User Input as my function.
I have created a piece that aims to simulate a sense of movement and rhythm found in nature while giving users control over key visual parameters. By adjusting the sliders, you can influnce the artwork's appearance in real time to create your own unique interpretation of the artwork.

##How to Interact

The controls are located in the Artwork Controls panel on the side.

Background Colour: Adjust the brightness and contrast of the underlying image.
Background Circles Zoom: Change the spacing between circular elements in the flow field creating a zoom in and out.
Outside Lines Movement: Alters the colur intensity of the lines and moves them from left to right.
Outside Lines Zoom: Controls the size of the outside lines around the weaves.
Weave Colour: Adjusts the color saturation of the circular weaves.
